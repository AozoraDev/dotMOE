/**
 * Database Version 2
 * 
 * * Summary *
 * On Saturday May 18 2024, there's a weirdy bug where db.ts failed to delete the the post from db after fetching.
 * This happens because sometimes, post_id value can be null even when the column is PRIMARY KEY.
 * It makes the code failed to delete the post from database because the code cannot find the post_id to remove.
 * As a result, everytime service.ts executed, it just posting the same post again and again.
 * 
 * * Solution *
 * This migration will create new column as primary (ROWID) and dropping post_id as primary.
 * db.ts is also modified to delete from ROWID instead of post_id.
 * Also, i'm adding "provider" column for saving provider's name for the future need.
